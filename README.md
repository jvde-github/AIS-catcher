# AIS-catcher

AIS-catcher is a versatile dual-channel AIS receiver compatible with various Software Defined Radios (SDRs) including RTL-SDR, AirSpy, HackRF, SDRPlay, and SoapySDR.

## Overview

- Lightweight command-line utility to receive and decode AIS signals
- Outputs AIS messages in NMEA format over UDP, TCP, HTTP, and to screen
- Incorporates web interface to visualize vessels on map 
- Can log messages to PostgreSQL database
- Supports multiple SDRs for simultaneous scanning
- Works across Linux, Windows, MacOS, Raspberry Pi, and other platforms

## Purpose 

The goal of AIS-catcher is to provide a platform to advance AIS receiver algorithms. We welcome contributions of recordings, especially where existing models have difficulties, to improve decoding robustness.
