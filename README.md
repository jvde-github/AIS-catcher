# AIS-catcher: A multi-platform AIS Receiver

This repository presents the `AIS-catcher` software, a versatile dual-channel AIS receiver that is compatible with a wide range of Software Defined Radios (SDRs). These include RTL-SDR dongles (such as the ShipXplorer AIS dongle and RTL SDR Blog v4), AirSpy (Mini/R2/HF+), HackRF, SDRPlay, SoapySDR, and file/network input (ZMQ/RTL-TCP/SpyServer). AIS-catcher delivers output in the form of NMEA messages, which can be conveniently displayed on screen or forwarded via UDP/HTTP/TCP. Designed as a lightweight command line utility, AIS-catcher also incorporates a built-in web server for internal use within secure networks. The project home page including several realtime examples can be found at [www.aiscatcher.org](https://www.aiscatcher.org).

## Purpose

The purpose of `AIS-catcher` is to serve as a platform that encourages the perpetual enhancement of receiver models. We greatly value and appreciate any suggestions, observations, or shared recordings, particularly from setups where the existing models encounter difficulties.
